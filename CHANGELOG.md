# Changelog

All notable changes to Notai are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each app in this monorepo is versioned independently:

| App                       | Triggers release on                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@notai/web`              | every push to `main` (Vercel git integration, auto-deploy)   |
| `@notai/realtime-server`  | bump in `apps/realtime-server/package.json` merged to `main` |
| `@notai/desktop`          | tag `desktop-v*` (also auto-tagged on `apps/desktop` bump)   |

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pre-commit and pre-push hooks (Husky + lint-staged) enforcing format, lint,
  typecheck, build, and a CHANGELOG entry on version bumps.
- `getFolder` server action and `previewHtml` preview field on `listNotes`.
- GitHub Actions (release-only — quality gates run locally before push):
  - `release-realtime.yml` — builds the Docker image and rolls out the
    Hocuspocus server to Cloud Run when `apps/realtime-server/package.json`
    version changes on `main`.
  - `release-desktop.yml` — builds and signs Windows / macOS / Linux installers
    via `tauri-apps/tauri-action` and publishes a GitHub Release when
    `apps/desktop/package.json` version changes on `main`.
- Vercel git integration handles the web app — auto-deploys on every push
  to `main`. `apps/web/vercel.json` + `scripts/vercel-should-build.mjs`
  skip rebuilds when the commit didn't touch the web app.
- Optional self-host `apps/web/Dockerfile` for non-Vercel targets.
- `scripts/check-changelog.mjs` and `scripts/detect-version-bumps.mjs` helpers.

### Changed

- ESLint flat config in `apps/web` now uses the documented
  `import nextPlugin from 'eslint-config-next'` entry point (the `flat.js`
  subpath was removed in `eslint-config-next@16`).

### Fixed

- TypeScript: missing `getFolder` import in the folder page; missing
  `previewHtml` field on note cards.
- ESLint: `postcss.config.mjs` anonymous default export warning; React 19
  `set-state-in-effect` rule disabled for legitimate mount-only reads.

## [@notai/realtime-server 0.1.2] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- Dockerfile now uses `pnpm deploy` to flatten workspace symlinks; the
  previous image failed to start with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for
  `@hocuspocus/server` because pnpm's symlink layout was not preserved
  across multi-stage `COPY`.

## [@notai/realtime-server 0.1.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- First Cloud Run deployment to `europe-west1` (project `notai-prod`).
- `release-realtime.yml` now wires Secret Manager refs for `DATABASE_URL`
  and `HOCUSPOCUS_JWT_SECRET`, sets port 1234, session affinity, and uses
  the `notai-deploy` service account.

## [@notai/desktop 0.1.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- `release-desktop` workflow: drop `beforeBuildCommand` (Tauri loads remote
  URL at runtime, no need to rebuild Next inside `tauri-action`).
- `WebviewWindowBuilder::transparent(false)` removed — gated behind opt-in
  Cargo feature in tauri 2.10, broke macOS/Linux/Windows compilation.
- Skip optional Apple/Tauri signing env vars when secrets are empty;
  unsigned installers ship by default until certs are configured.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Initial monorepo scaffold with Next.js 16 web app, Hocuspocus realtime
  server, Tauri 2 desktop shell, shared `@notai/db`, `@notai/editor`,
  `@notai/lib`, `@notai/ui` packages.
- Drizzle schema for users, folders, notes, tags, collaborators, assets.
- Auth.js v5 with Google OAuth and Drizzle adapter.
- TipTap editor + tldraw drawing surface bound to a shared Y.Doc.
- PWA support via `@serwist/next`.
- Terraform configuration for GCP (Cloud Run, Artifact Registry,
  Secret Manager, Storage).
