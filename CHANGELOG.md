# Changelog

All notable changes to Notai are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Each app in this monorepo is versioned independently and released through its
own GitHub Actions workflow:

| App                       | Triggers release on                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@notai/web`              | bump in `apps/web/package.json` merged to `main`            |
| `@notai/realtime-server`  | bump in `apps/realtime-server/package.json` merged to `main`|
| `@notai/desktop`          | tag `desktop-v*` (also auto-tagged on `apps/desktop` bump)  |

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pre-commit and pre-push hooks (Husky + lint-staged) enforcing format, lint,
  typecheck, build, and a CHANGELOG entry on version bumps.
- `getFolder` server action and `previewHtml` preview field on `listNotes`.
- GitHub Actions (release-only — quality gates run locally before push):
  - `release-web.yml` — builds and deploys the web app to Vercel when
    `apps/web/package.json` version changes on `main`.
  - `release-realtime.yml` — builds the Docker image and rolls out the
    Hocuspocus server to Cloud Run when `apps/realtime-server/package.json`
    version changes on `main`.
  - `release-desktop.yml` — builds and signs Windows / macOS / Linux installers
    via `tauri-apps/tauri-action` and publishes a GitHub Release when
    `apps/desktop/package.json` version changes on `main`.
- `vercel.json` and `apps/web/Dockerfile` for hybrid deploy targets.
- `scripts/check-changelog.mjs` and `scripts/detect-version-bumps.mjs` helpers.

### Changed

- ESLint flat config in `apps/web` now uses the documented
  `import nextPlugin from 'eslint-config-next'` entry point (the `flat.js`
  subpath was removed in `eslint-config-next@16`).

### Fixed

- TypeScript: missing `getFolder` import in the folder page; missing
  `previewHtml` field on note cards.
- ESLint: `postcss.config.mjs` anonymous default export warning; React 19
  `set-state-in-effect` rule disabled for legitimate mount-only reads.
